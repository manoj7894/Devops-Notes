# What is the Version Control
Version control system (VCS) is a software that helps you manage changes to your code over time. 
It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track changes, and easily revert back to previous versions if needed. 
One popular VCS is Git.

# We have two version control system
1) Centralized Version Control System
2) Distributed Version Control System

# Centralized Version Control System
It will maintain only one copy on server. If Network got went down we wont work

# Distributed Version Control System
It will maintain two copies both server and local repo

# What is git (Global Information Tracker)
Git is a distribution version control system that allow people collaborate on project

# what is git hub
Git having the repository

# what is repository
Repository having the source code data

# Git Commands
git init .   --> To create the local repo
git add .    --> Take files from untracked and modified staged to stagged stage [Untracked means newly created files][modify means if you do any change in file after commit then file it commes unstagged or modifyes staged]
git config --global user.name <write some name>
git config --global user.email <write mail id> to set the author name and email id to the files
git commit -m "somename"  (or) git commit -m .   --> take staged files into local repo
git remote add origin <git hub url>  --> To add the origin
if you want to change the origin name
git remote add <name>  -->  To add the origin name
git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>   --> To Rename the origin name
git remote remove <name>  --> To remove the origin name
git remote -v  --> To see list of remote
git log  --> To see the commit history
git push -u origin branch name --> push the data from local repo to git hub repo
git branch  --> To see the git branches [It is used to maintain the spearate code base is called git branch]
git branch <branch name>  --> To create the branch name
git checkout -b <branch name>  --> It create the new branch and checkout that branch
git checkout <branch name>   --> To shift from one branch to another branch
git merge <branch name>      --> [It merge the changes from one branch to another branch][It maintain the commit history]
# Merges are two types
1) fast forward merge  --> we will merge without commit
2) recursive       --> we will merge after commit
git rebase <branch name>    --> [It merge the changes from one branch to another branch][It does not mainatain the commit history]
git stash   --> [it save the changes from local repo to tempory location to make working directory clean]
git stash list  --> To see stash list
git stash apply --> It will take lastet file from git stash. that file wont delete in git stash when we do git stash apply
git stash drop  --> It will delete files in git stash 
git stash pop   --> It will take latest file as well as it will delete file automatically in git stash
git stash apply stash@{enter stash number}   --> it will take particular files from git stash
git stash -u    --> It moved the file into untracked stage from git stash
git stash branch <branch name>   --> if you want to create to separate branch with git stash files
git reset --soft HEAD~1   --> To take the commit files to untracked stage
git reset          --> To take the stagged file to untracked stage
git diff           --> To see the whichever data in untracked stage files


# When you get below error while doing git push 
you will use below to command to seems like this master -> master
-> git fetch origin master:tmp
-> git rebase tmp
-> git push --set-upstream origin master

# If you want to push the data into Another branch
First you have to checkout from whichever branch do you want to push the data to git repo
[when you do the push to another branch master files also will come to that branch along with new files]

# It you want to merger files from one branch to another branch
you would be keep in destination place and use the git merge command. when you do the merge in terminal it wont apply in git hub
if you want to check the files ls -l

# It you want to use the pull command
when someone changes code in git hub then you will use git pull command 
Git pull command it will take code from git repo to local repo
If you want to pull changes to another branch you will use this below command keep in branch
git pull <repo Url> branch name

# What is git branch strategy
we have 5 branches
master  --> It is a Production means live env and it having existing code
feature  --> If we want to update any existing app then we will create the feature branch after complete the code update we will merge the code into master branch
release  --> Ready to delivered to the customres
Hot fix  --> If customer raise the any problem then we will create hotfix branch and we will reslove that problem. we will merge the code into master branch after reslove the problem

# What are the difference difference between new repo and new project
New repo  --> It is the part of git and git hub
New project --> It is the part of only git hub

# What is pull request
Akowledge and review the changes
It merge the changes from one branch from another branch
We can create pull request in two types
1) Pull request to repository
2) Pull request to branch within repository

# What is GubHub Project
If you want to assign any repositories project to particular person and daily get the status of the repository then you will use Project
