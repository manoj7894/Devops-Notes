-> When you delete the pod in statefulset then it will delete the whatever pod cretead latestly
-> If you want to host the database in kubernetes then you will use statefulset

what are the difference between stateful and deployment
statefulset
-> When we delete the pod in statefulset then another pod will create on same name
-> we need persistance volume and persistance volumeclaim to create the statefulset
Deployment
-> When we delete the pod in statefulset then another pod will create with another name
-> Persistance volume and persistance volumeclaim It doesnt mandatory to create the statefulset

Statefulset-Data Replication
Data Replication: Since each pod in the statefulset has its own pv and pvc, data replication can be handled
 at the storage level
How to work with statefulset
-> You have to execute the service.yml
-> You have to execute the configmap.yml
-> You have to execute the secret.yml
-> You have to execute the persistence,volume.yml
-> After execute the all above file later you have to execute the statefulset
