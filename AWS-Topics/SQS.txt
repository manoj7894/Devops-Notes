# What is SQS
-> SQS stands Simple Queue service(SQS) is a reliable, scalable, fully-managed message queuing service.
-> Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than maximun message retention period.
-> The default message retention period is 4 days.
-> You can set the message retention period to a value from 60 seconds to 1209600 seconds(14 days) using the setqueueattributes action.

# We have two type of Queue
1) Standard Queue
2) FIFO Queue

# What is Standard Queue
-> It is a default Queue
-> You can create standard queue in all AWS regions
-> It supports unlimited number of transactions per second per action
-> Supports at-least-once message delivery. Occasionally more than one copy of a message might be deliverd out of order
-> Which ensure that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they sent. this is not guaranteed


# What is FIFO Queue
-> FIFO Queue have all the capabilities of the standard queue
-> To create FIFO queue its queue name must be end .fifo
-> FIFO queue can create some regions
-> FIFO (First-in-first-out) messages are generally delivered in the same order as they sent. duplicates cant be tolerated
-> FIFO queues also provide exactly-once processing but have a limited number of transactions per second(TPS)
-> FIFO queues support upto 3000 messages per second with batching
-> FIFO queues support upto 300 messages per second per action


# Key points
-> You cant change the queue type after you create it and you cant convert an existing standard queue into FIFO queue
-> If you delete a queue, you must wair at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with same time

# What is Dead-letter [When message is not working then you will move message to dead-letter and segregate and reslove that problem]
-> Dead-letter queue is a queue that other queue can leverage to isolate or segregate messages that cannot be processed sucessfully by consumer
-> When a source queue is created you can assgin a dead-letter queue for that source queue
-> The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must aslo be a standard queue
-> Bothe source queue and dead letter queue must in the same AWS account and and region

# Message retention and Dead-Letter Queues
-> It is recommended that the message retention period of a dead-letter queue should be longer than the retention period of the original queue
Eg:-
-> If the retention period of the dead-letter queue is 5 days
-> Message was in the source queue for 1 day retention period before being moved to the dead-letter queue
-> Message will be deleted from the dead-letter queue after 4 days

# Where is a message moved to a dead-letter Queue
-> A message is moved to a dead-letter queue after the maxReceiveCount for a message exceeds.

Note:- To configure the dead-letter queue, use Redrive Policy of the Source queue

# How to create Queue
-> You go SQS and click whichever you want wheather standard or FIFO
Note: If you select the SQS it will tolrate the duplicate messages 
      If you Select FIFO it wont tolrate the duplicate messages

-> Give name to queue
-> Visibility timeout -> When would message will appear to other process
-> Message retention period -> How many days message would be in queue
-> Delivery delay -> No-one can access the message from qube upto 60 seconds after add the message in queue
-> Maximum message size -> size of message Should be between 1 KB and 256 KB.
-> Receive message wait time  -> when should receiver get message
-> create the SQS

# If you want to add dead-letter queue

# What is Purge Queue
-> Deletes all messages in the queue
-> After you purge a queue you cannot retrive any deleted messages
-> It takes up to 60 seconds to purge a queue\
-> Messages sent to the queue before you call purgequeue might be received but are deleted within the next time
-> Messages sent to the queue after you call purgequeue might be deleted while the queue is being purged

# What is delete queue
-> Deletes the selected queue
-> After you delete a queue you cannot retrive any messages that were present in queue
-> It takes Up to 60 seconds to delete a queue
-> Any requests received during the deletion process will succeed
-> You must wait 60 sec to create a queue with the same name after it is deleted
-> A queue can be deleted even when it is not empty. If you want to delete ONLY the message in the queue but not the queue, use purge queue
