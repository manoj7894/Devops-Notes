# What is Elastic Cache [Port number is 6379]
-> Elastic cache is used to to reduce the load on data base.

# What is the difference between RDS and Elastic cache
-> RDS will save the data in volume types [It save in Hard disk]
-> Elastic cache save the data in RAM 

# Elastic cache are two types
1) Redis 
2) Memcached

# Redis Elastic cache
-> Redis is used for game purpose. Mostly all peoples are used redis
-> we will place redis in multiple Avaliablility Zones
-> Backup feature is avaliable in redis
-> We can create read replicas in redis

# Memcached
-> Backup feature is not avaliable in Memcache
-> No multiple Avaliablility Zones avaliable in Memcache
-> We cant create read replicas in Memcache

# How to create Elastic cache
-> Go to elastic cache and create cluster
-> Create Redis cluster
-> Click Configure and create a new cluster
-> Cluster mode 
  if click Enable the cluster mode you will get replicas across multi sharing
  if click Disable doesnt apply
-> Give name
-> Click AWS cloud [It is location]
-> If you want Mulit_AZ if will enable
-> Auto-failover [It will provide the high avaliablity through Auto-failover to read the replica in case primary node failover.
-> chose instance type t2.micro
-> if you want custom VPC then you will create otherwise you will choose default VPC
-> If You want encryption you will click othewise leave it
-> Next
-> Crate

# After create the Elastic cache 
If you want to connect Elastic cache with Ec2
-> yum install telnet -y
-> telnet <give elastic cache configuration endpoint>   [give without portnumber]
