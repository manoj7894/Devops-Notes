# What is Elastic Load Balancer[It overcome the loads on server to increase the server capacity]
It automatically scales and balances the load to ensure high avaliablity and fault tolerance for application

# Types of Load Balancer
1) Classic Load Balancer
2) Application Load Balancer
3) Network Load Balancer
4) Gateway Load Balancer

Classic Load Balancer
It is a Old version
Aws is not recommand because it cost is very high

Application Load Balancer
It advance version of Classic load balancer
It support the port mapping (related to http and https)

Network Load Balancer
It will work as transport layer
It will work main on TCP and UDP protocols
TCP [Transmission control protocol]
UDP [User dataground protocol]

Gateway Load Balancer

# How to create the Load Balancer
-> First we will create two instances and connect two instances with mobaxstream
-> you will install below commands in both instances
	sudo yum update
	sudo yum install httpd -y
	sudo service httpd start
	sudo service httpd enable
	sudo service httpd status
	cd /var/www/html/
	sudo vi index.html
-> We will write something differently in both instances
-> After that you will browser your Ip and along with 80 port to both instances
-> Before we create load balancer we will create target-group
-> Go to target-group and create the target group and add your instances in target group
-> After create target-group and go to load balancer and create load balancer with that target group
-> After create load balancer then you will take load balancer DNS URL and paste the browser
