# What is Auto Scaling
We have two types of auto scaling
1) Horizontal Auto scaling  -> Horizontial Scalling increase the number of instances
2) vertical Auto scaling  -> Vertical Scalling increase the capacity of system (like CPU capacity)

Note: We need to ELB to create target groups.

Horizontal scaling Divied into three types
1) Dynamic scalling
2) Scheduled scalling
3) Predictive scalling

# What is Dynamic scalling
-> It will work based on CPU theshold
-> If load overcome 80% on cpu then it will create another instance

# What is Scheduled scalling
-> It will the schedule the instance when instances will launch

# What is Predictive scalling
-> It will apprised wheather add the server or remove server

# How to create Autoscaling
-> After create ELB
-> Fisrt you will create AMI image to which instance do you want to do autoscaling
-> Click on instance, Go to actions, click image and template, click create image 
-> give image name
-> enable Noreboot
-> Clikc Tag image and snapshots together
-> create image 
-> After create the AMI image. you will go auto scalling and click create auto scalling
-> Give name
-> create launch template
-> give template name
-> Click Auto Scaling guidance
-> Click My AMIS and choose ami image
-> choose instance type
-> choose key pair
-> choose security group whichever you have given in ELB
-> launch the template
-> Come to auto scaling and choose that templete 
-> Next
-> choose VPC Whichever VPC you have used in ELB
-> Select all subnets
-> Next
-> click Attach to an existing load balancer
-> Click Choose from your load balancer target groups
-> Choose target group
-> Click Turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks
-> Next
-> choose you desired instances
-> Click Target tracking scaling policy
-> Next
-> Next
-> Next
-> Create

-> After create the auto scaling. you will go target group and check the health status
-> After you will go Ec2 instances and click that new instance and copy the IP and paste IP in browser
-> If you terminated the instance then you will get the new instance

Note: Auto scaling wont apply the target group instances
