# What is Cloudtrial
-> We will check the details who is running our instance or who was terminated our service by using cloud trail
-> Cloudtrail is regional service it is not a global service

# What is the difference between Cloudtrail and Cloudwatch
-> Cloudtrail
   -> It will work to check the account level logging  [Account logging means Ec2 instance and S3 bucket create or stop] 
-> Cloud watch
   -> It will work to check the application related source data

# We have two components in Cloud trail
-> Event Histroy
-> Trails

# Event History
-> It is defaulty enable option
-> Aws is provided free
-> Only 90 days data is available in event history
-> In event history we can see only who is running or stop our instance and who is created and deleted the s3 buckets
-> We cant do any modification in event history
-> We cant do any integration [Integration menas you cant keep the log files in S3 bucket]

# Trails
-> we need to enable custom
-> We need to pay the money based on destination storage
-> We can do integration below those services in trails
   1) S3 2) CWL(cloud watch logs) 3) Event Bridge
   -> We can check the trails logs in above services
-> If we want to do any integration with any third party service then we will use Event bridge.

# We have two types of Trails
-> Region Based Trail  [If you select region it will work upto to particular region]
-> Multi Region Based Trail   [If you select Multi region it will work in all regions. If any region add in feature it will work in that region aslo]

# We have three types events in Trail
-> Management Event  [If you want to do any resource creation or update it will comes under management event. It will support all the services in AWS] 
-> Data event   [If you want to do any data modification or creation or update in resources it will comes under data event. It support the S3, Lambda, dynamodb in AWS]
                [To see the data level modification in s3 bucket then you will use Data event]
-> Insights   [We will use Insight to find the unuseual activites]

# We have two events in Management Event
-> Write Management Event  [It indicates the Ec2 create, Ec2 stop or run, Volume attached to Ec2. It will work like that]
-> Read Management Event   [It indicates the List of buckets, List of objects and List of instances. It will work like that]

-> If you enable the log file validation option. It will let you know if anyone do any modification in log files in trails
