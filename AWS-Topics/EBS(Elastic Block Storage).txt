# What is EBS (Elastic block storage)
-> Elastic block storage is a scalable block storage server provided by AWS for Ec2.
-> It allows you to create and attach persistance the storage volume to your instances
-> All Ec2 instance data stored in EBS

Note: We cannt use EBS directly. we will use EBS using below servers
	EC2, RDS, ECS, Redis

# Type of Storages in AWS
	1) Block level storage  -> EBS Service
	2) File level storage   -> EFS Service
	3) object level storage -> S3 service 
	4) Server type storage  -> RDS Service

# Types of Block storage
	1) EBS  -> It persistance the data
	2) Instance Type -> It doesnot persistance data

# What are the difference between EBS and Instance store

-> Elastic block storage
	1) It persistance data
	2) It has distance between instance and storage
	3) Data transffer speed is low
	4) It will matained the another copy
	5) When you do the reboot data will persistance
	6) When you stop the instance data will save

-> Instance store
	1) It doesnt persistance data
	2) It has no distance between instance and storage
	3) Data transffer speed is high	
	4) It will not matained the another copy
	5) When you do the reboot data will persistance
	6) When you stop the instance data will not save 

# Description Of EBS
-> We can attach the 16 EBS to one Ec2 instance
-> We will use 16TB to 64TB sizes attach to the EBS
-> One EBS can attach different Ec2 by using EBS multi attach
-> We have two types of Hypervisiors in AWS
	1) Xen hypervisior -> It will not work to attach mulit EBS attach
	2) Nitro hypervisior -> It will work to attach mulit EBS attach

# Types of Elastic Block storage
	1) SSD -> It provide fast performance than HDD [Solid State Disk]
	2) HDD -> It is slower storage performance than SDD [Hard Disk Drive]

-> SSD it will work based on IOPS -> Input Output Per second
-> HDD it will work based on throughput

# Tyeps of SSD [It will work based on IOPS]
	1) General purpose -> It will support min 100 max 16000 IOPS (volume size 1Gb To 16TB)
	2) Provision IOPS -> It will support maximum 64000 IOPS (volume size 4Gb To 16TB)

In Genearal purpose
gp2 -> default 100 IOPS
gp3 -> 3000 IOPS        

-> When we create the Ec2 instance defaulty it will take gp2 storage
-> 1Gb = 3 iops 
-> But when we create the Ec2 instance it will provide 8Gb with gp2
-> Why it will 8Gb because to difficult to work with 24 IOPS so that defaulty it will provide 8Gb with 100 IOPS
-> Suppose if you want to increase your IOPS to 300 IOPS then you will get 100Gb

Provision IOPS
1) Io1 -> It will support min 100 max 64000 IOPS (volume size 4Gb To 16TB)
2) Io2 -> It will support min 100 max 64000 IOPS (volume size 4Gb To 16TB)
3) Io2 block express -> It will support > 64000 IOPS

-> I01 and I02 IOPS will support only nitro based hypervision instances
-> I02 block express will support only R5B instance

# Tyeps of HDD [It will work based on throughput]
1) st1 -> It will support 500 Mbps (volume size 125Gb To 16TB)
2) sc -> It will support 250 Mbps (volume size 125Gb To 16TB)

-> We will use if we want to work on less operation on more data then we will use HDD
-> It could not support to create the Ec2 instance only SSD disk will support

# What is Snapshot [It will take the volume backup]
1) EBS snapshots are point-in-time copies of your EBS volume
2) We can create up to 5000 EBS volumes in single account
3) We can create up to 10000 EBS snapshots in single account
4) We can migrate EBS volume from region to another region by usign Snapshort

# How to get Backup and restrore data using EBS volume
-> You will create one instance and connect the instance and go root and create the some files there
-> Go to volumes and click on volume and go to actions and create snapchat
-> Go to Ec2 instance and terminate that instance
-> lateron go snapchat and click that snapchat and go actions and click create volume from snapchart
-> lateron you will create aonther instance with same volume avaliablity zone
-> After complete create Ec2. you will stop that instance
-> After stop the instance you will go to volumes and detach and delete stop instance volume 
-> Click the avaliable use vloume in volumes and go to actions and attach the volume to stop instance and give which root volume you instance contain /dev/xvda
   you have to give that root volume name there
-> After attach the volume to instance you will start that instance and you will login and check the files would there or not

Note: Snapchat will store in S3 bucket but you wont manage. AWS will manage this things

# How to copy the snapchat from one region to another region
-> click on snapchart and go to actions and copy the snap and select region whichever region you want to keep

# What is AMI
AMI stands for Amazon machine image. Its a template that contains a software configuration for virtual machine on amazon web service
# How to Create the AMI image
-> First you will create one instance and connect instance and create some file in that instance
-> later on go to snap chart and create the snap chart and click instance
-> After create the snap chart you will terminate the instance and go to snap chart and click the snapchart and go to actions and click create image from snap
-> Give only the name and create image and go ami and click that ami and lanunch instance
-> After create the instance check the files wheather it would there are not whichever files you have created in past instance
