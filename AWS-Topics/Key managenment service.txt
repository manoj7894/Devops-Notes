# What is Encryption
To convert file into plaintext to cipher text by using encryption   [only write access]

# What is Decryprion
We will use key to convert cipher text to plain text   [only read access]

# Types of Encryption
1) Server side encryption
2) Client side encryption
3) Encryption in Transit

# Server side encryption
Whereever you stored the file that endlocation should be encryption that is called server side encryption

# Client side encryption
Where you will encrypt the file from your laptop. you will upload the file after encrypt file in your system

# Encryption in Transit
By using Https protocal both source and destination persons will send and retrive the data securely

# Types of Encryption key types
1) Symmetric key
2) A symmetric key

# Symmetric key
We will use same keys both encryption and decryption to the data

# A Symmetric key
We will use different keys both encryption and decryption 
Public key use for encryption to the data
Private key use for decryption to the data

# we will use key usages in two places
1) Encryption and Decryption
2) Sign and Verify

Note: Mostly we will use in Encryption and Decryption places

# What is Envelop encryption 
-> Envelop encryption is the another security layer to the encryption
-> We will use envelop encryption for large files
-> We will use Encryption DEK to Envelop encryption
  detailed in book

# What is Envelop decryption
We will use normarl key to envelop decryption

# What are the difference between Symmetric key and A Symmetric key
Symmetric key
-> Single key we use to encryption and decryption the data
-> All Aws services we will use Symmetric key
-> If more than large file (4MB) then we will use Envelop decryption
A Symmetric key
-> we will use different keys to encryption and decryption the data
  Public key use for encryption to the data
  Private key use for decryption to the data
-> We will use this key Outside of AWS

# AWS KMS key there are two types of services
1) AWS managed keys   --> Every thing will managed by AWS
2) Customer managed keys  --> Customer will manage the all key material
   key material available
  1) AWS given
  2) Imported key material
  3) cloud HSM
  4) Ecternal key store

# AWSKMS Key Rotation
-> KeyID will be same even when create the another key after some days [It will appear same value to outside but internally value will change]
-> No impact on data keys

# Single and multi region keys
-> If you enable the single region when you creating the key then you can access that key only that particular region
-> If you enable the Multi region when you creating the key then you can access that key all the regions
running notes
-> if you do key rotation then all the regions will change
-> if you think i will create multi single region. if you create multi single region then it will get headache when you do key rotation. so that we will use multi region

# How to S3 Access to various users
-> If you want to see the pratical you will look into below link
   https://youtu.be/bSbyDXHVOEc?si=68qsWdQb79eF86jp
-> You will create one user along with Adminationaccess policy after create the user you will login that user
-> After login you will create the 3 users along with s3 bucker policy
-> After create the users you will create the key managnment and next and give name.
    add 1st user as a admin and add 2nd user as key user and finishs
-> After that you will create one s3 bucket along with KMS key
-> go to S3 and give name and click Server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS)
-> Click Choose from your AWS KMS keys and select your KMS whichever you have above
-> Create the bucket
-> You go key managnment and click the key and click switch to policy view and edit
-> you will follow the video to edit the encryption data and extra data
